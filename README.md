# uiowa-course-scheduler

Rails project based off of the idea started at https://github.com/nshoeheart/maui-scheduler - creating a web application to help students at The University of Iowa create a course schedule for themselves to register in without having to manually comb through all the possible combinations themselves on MyUI.
